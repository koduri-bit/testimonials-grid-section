# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

I did this challenge using HTML and CSS. No code used as described in the challenge.

The challenge is from frontendmentor.io, and it is best place for any frontend developers to be involved in design and development.

Slack community is the right place to get feedback from the frontendmentor community.

I really appreciate frontendentor.io for their work and I am really happy to learn and submit more and more solutions in near future.


## Please see the below to be involved and submit solutions from frontendmentor.io
